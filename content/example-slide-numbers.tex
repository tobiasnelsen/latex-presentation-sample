\begin{frame}{Slide numbers}

  Take a look at the slide numbers at the bottom right! 

  \begin{itemize}
    \item At the title slide no slide number is given
    \item The \textit{Sources} at the end of the presentation
          comprise multiple slides. Nevertheless, the slide 
          numbers don't increase by more than one. This is due
          to using the \textit{multipleslidetrue/false} command
          in combination with the \textit{allowframebreaks}
          option.
  \end{itemize}
