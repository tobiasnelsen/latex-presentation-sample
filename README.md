Showcase for basic latex presentation features.

Compile the latex presentation `presentation.tex` into a PDF file by 
+ executing `pdflatex presentation.tex` (possibly [multiple](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/30330/how-can-i-avoid-compiling-twice) times). 
+ or use https://github.com/reitzig/ltx2any: After having [installed](https://github.com/reitzig/ltx2any/wiki]) ltx2any, compiling can be achieved by executing `ruby <path-to-clone-of-ltx2any>\ltx2any.rb presentation.tex`. This command is also included in the `compile.bat` file.
