Sample latex presentation to show basic latex presentation features. If you like what you see, you might use this as a starting point to create your own latex presentation!

Compile the latex presentation `presentation.tex` into a PDF file 
+ by (recommended) using your Latex editor
+ or by executing `pdflatex presentation.tex` (possibly [multiple](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/30330/how-can-i-avoid-compiling-twice) times)
+ or (recommended) by [installing](https://github.com/reitzig/ltx2any/wiki]) ltx2any and executing the `compile.bat` batch script (please adjust the path to your `ltx2any.rb` file inside this script).
